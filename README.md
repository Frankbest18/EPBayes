# EPBayes

## Simulation
Simulation scripts for EPBayes (1D_NPMLE, 2D_NPMLE), Welch Approximation, Pooled t-test

## Real Dataset
1. Applying All Algorithms (1D_NPMLE, 2D_NPMLE, Welch Approximation, Pooled t-test) on Hedenfalk
2. Incorporating weight information based on (Voom, VoombyGroup) with All Algorithms (1D_NPMLE, 2D_NPMLE, Welch Approximation, Pooled t-test) on PBMC1

## Data and Graphs
1. 2D Distribution Estimation based on Real Datasets (Hedenfalk, PBMC1) and Visualization
2. Comparison between All Algorithms (1D_NPMLE, 2D_NPMLE, Welch Approximation, Pooled t-test) concerning Power and FDR for (n1 $in$ (3,4,5,6,7), n2 = (n1: n1+6))
    * Separated Data contains simulation results for each of the four algorithms
    * Full Data contains the united simulation results processed via Data_organizer.R
